# Legacy Linux Config files

CAUTION: **This is my "old"** config featuring Hyprland. I have since moved to automatic install scripts which you can find in `arch_install_scripts` in this repository, one directory up. I keep those for historical value. It's no longer maintained and may contain outdated tools / configuration options

## Introduction

This project contains various files I use to configure my Linux OS (https://www.archlinux.org/[Arch Linux]), my shell (https://www.zsh.org/[ZSH]) my terminal client (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/[kitty]), and my Window manager (https://hyprland.org[Hyperland]).

Feel free to copy those scripts, but use at your own risks.

## Tools I use
I describe my system config in this https://github.com/Jubijub/arch-config/wiki/1.Home[howto], so you can see how I install those tools. I mostly use Arch/AUR packages where possible.

### Themes
* Color Theme : https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin[Catppuccin-Macchiato] - super good looking pastel theme
* Icon theme : https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme[Papirus-Dark]
* Cursor theme = https://github.com/catppuccin/cursors[Catppuccin-Macchiato-Dark]
* Font : https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/[Jetbrains Mono] with https://www.nerdfonts.com/[Nerd fonts patch].

### Software

* https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/[kitty] : my favourite terminal emulator : it's fast, it's well documented, it supports ligatures.


### Command line utilities / Development tools

My ZSH installation procedure is described https://github.com/Jubijub/arch-config/wiki/5.Post-installation#configure-zsh[here].

* https://www.zsh.org[zsh] : a better alternative to Bash, with strong completion. Eminently themable with powerlevel10k. Note : I do not use oh-my-zsh or any package manager, which keeps my zsh light and predictible.
  ** https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k[Powerlevel10k] : a fantastic and blazing fast Zsh theme
  ** https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting[Fast-Syntax-highlighting] : on the fly syntax highlighting when typing commands.
  ** https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions[Autosuggestions] : fish like autosuggestions based on history
  ** https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] : a fuzzy search tool to search command line history. I couldn't live without this.
* https://github.com/sharkdp/bat[bat]: a replacement to `cat` with syntax highlighting, line numbering, etc...
* https://the.exa.website/[exa] : a replacement for `ls` with colors, git aware, highly configurable
* https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch[neofetch] : command line system information, used for my screenshots.
* https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry] : a python packaging and dependency (and virtualenv) manager.
* https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/reflector[reflector] : a script that test the speed of Archlinux mirror, and picks the most suitable to overwrite the mirrorlist.

### Desktop environment
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst] : a customizable notification system
* https://flameshot.org/[Flameshot] : a screenshot software with good editing capabilities (arrows, frames, text)
* https://github.com/yshui/picom[picom (picom-git)] : a window compositor which enables gaps, window transparency on a per program basis
* https://www.qtile.org[qtile] : the Qtile window manager (configured in Python)
* https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[rofi] : an app launcher and a window switcher.

## Config files
The file hierarchy mimics the target structure on the disk, so if you find a file in `a/b/c/file.ext`, it should be copied in `/a/b/c/file.ext`.

### etc

* `/etc/pacman.d/hooks` : various hooks for reflector, nvidia, and systemd-boot
  ** `mirrorupgrade.hook` : triggers `reflector` to upgrade pacman mirrorlist after each pacman-mirrorlist package update (also cleans the mirrorlist.pacnew)
  ** `nvidia.hook` : triggers `mkinitcpio` after each nvidia / nvidia-lts drivers package update
  ** `systemd-boot.hook` : triggers a systemd-boot update after each systemd-boot package update
* `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf` : the X.org config that works with my nVidia RTX 3090 and my dual screen setup
* `/etc/locale.conf` : my wierd locale setup where local is set to fr_CH, but my display language is English.
* `/etc/resolvconf.conf` : resolvconf config to set Google DNS as the machine DNS.

### home/jubi

* `/home/jubi/.config/bat/*` : sets the bat theme as Catppuccin-machiato (also contains the theme files themselves, from Catppuccin https://github.com/catppuccin/bat[repository])
* `/home/jubi/.config/dunst/*` : sets the dunst theme as Catppuccin-machiato (from Catppuccin dunst https://github.com/catppuccin/dunst[repository])
* `/home/jubi/.config/flameshot/*` : instructs Flameshot to save screenshots as PNG in my Downloads folder
* `/home/jubi/.config/gtk-3.0/*` : GTK 3.0 theme configuration to use the Catppuccin color/cursor, and Papirus-Dark icons.
* `/home/jubi/.config/kitty/*` : instructs Kitty to use Catppuccin machiatto colors, and Jetbrains Mono Nerd font.
* `/home/jubi/.config/neofetch/*` : light changes to display more information
* `/home/jubi/.config/picom/*` : Gaps, window transparency with active window being less opaque
* `/home/jubi/.config/pypoetry/*`: Python Poetry config instructing to put virtualenvs in a specific folder.
* `/home/jubi/.config/qtile/*`: 
  * `qtile_icons`: layout icons matching the catppuccino color theme
  * `autostart.sh` : configures X (via xrandr) for my dual screen, loads picom, qtile, etc...
  * `config.py` : my qtile config file
* `/home/jubi/.config/rofi/*`: Rofi with https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi[catppuccin theme].
* `/home/jubi/.local/share/backgrounds` : the https://www.deviantart.com/dpcdpc11/art/Beyond-the-Clouds-Wallpaper-Pack-5120x2880px-915981762["Beyond the clouds"] desktop wallaper I use which goes well with Catppuccin colors, courtesy of https://www.deviantart.com/dpcdpc11[dpcdpc11].

* `/home/jubi/.p10k.zsh` : my ZSH Powerlevel10k configuration. I suggest you use the `p10k configure` to generate the file, and just use this for reference.
* `/home/jubi/.xinitrc` and `/home/jubi/.Xresources` : sets my X theme as Catppuccin Machiatto.
* `/home/jubi/.zshrc` and `/home/jubi/.zshenv` : my .zshrc : see my https://github.com/Jubijub/arch-config/wiki/5.Post-installation#configure-zsh[howto] on how I configure my ZSH.
